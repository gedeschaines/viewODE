Main Simulation
---------------

  Key Press Options:
    Esc = Exit simulation
    A   = Assemble figure
    G   = Toggle Render debug On/Off
    H   = Toggle Actions debug On/Off
    J   = Toggle Control debug On/Off
    X   = Reset simulation
    Z   = Toggle simulation pause On/Off
    /   = Toggle gravity fixed along world -Y axis On/Off
  
  Mouse Button and Motion Options:
    Left = Grab object (see Render class below.)
      With figure joint selected and figure collapsed, 
        apply force to joint solid in direction of mouse 
        motion.
      With figure solid selected, apply force to solid
        in direction of mouse motion.
      With target selected, apply force in direction of 
        mouse motion.
    Middle = (See Render class below.)
    Right  = Pause simulation while pressed.

Frame Class
-----------

  Key Press Options:
    B = Toggle ball joints On/Off
    C = Collapse frame
    F = Toggle joint and motor feedback On/Off
    S = Toggle slim arm and leg bones On/Off
    
    Note, pressing the B or S key will reset the figure's 
    animation state (i.e., standing up using zero error 
    restoring torques).
    
Actions Class
-------------

  Key Press Options:
    Space = Toggle suspend mode On/Off
    Y     = Toggle stride test mode On/Off
    K     = Toggle kick action On/Off
    R     = Toggle reach action On/Off
    U     = Toggle stand up action On/Off
    W     = Toggle walking action On/Off
  
    Note, the kick action is initiated when the target object
    is selected and the figure has at least one foot on the 
    ground plane.  The reach action is directed toward the 
    target object, which can be grabbed and moved using the
    left mouse button.
    
Control Class
-------------

  Key Press Options:
    0 = Toggle torque mode Off/On
    1 = Set torque mode On and forcing torque axis to 0
    2 = Set torque mode On and forcing torque axis to 1
    3 = Set torque mode On and forcing torque axis to 2 (default)
    + = Set forcing torque to positive direction (default)
    - = Set forcing torque to negative direction
    D = Toggle joint rotational damping On/Off
    E = Toggle zero error restoring torque Off/On
    L = Toggle non-forcing axis rotation error limiting On/Off
    M = Toggle maintain manipulated joint rotation Off/On
    T = Toggle torque feedback rotational damping Off/On
  
  Mouse Button and Motion Options:
    Left = Apply forcing torque to selected joint
      With the figure assembled and torque mode on, rotate 
      selected joint about the forcing torque axis.

Render Class
------------

  Key Press Options:
    . = Set world space rotation angles to zero
    I = Toggle image capture On/Off
    O = Set orthographic projection
    P = Set perspective projection
    V = Clear selection volume

  Mouse Button and Motion Options:
    Left = Select object and render as wire frame
      With render debug On, display selection volume and print 
      selection volume dimensions, and print selected object's 
      shape, name and location.
    Middle = Rotate world space about origin
      Vertical mouse motion rotates about world space X axis.
      Horizontal mouse motion rotates about world space Y axis.
